I'm proud to be the instructor for **EDCI 321, Literature for Children**, where we're halfway through an inspiring spring semester! 

I'm proud of the dedication and enthusiasm my students bring to each class. 💪🏼 One key strategy I employ to make this course practical is our hands-on approach. From literature circles to reading aloud, we bridge theory with real-world application, empowering our students to become effective and compassionate educators.
