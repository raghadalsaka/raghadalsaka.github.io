I'm thrilled to share two exciting updates on my journey:

🎓 **Doctorate in Education**  
I've embarked on a Doctorate in Education program in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the [University of Idaho, Moscow Campus](https://www.uidaho.edu/ed/ci/faculty/ra). Ready to dive into research and expand my expertise!

🍏 **Graduate Teaching Assistant**  
Simultaneously, I've also started a new position as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Idaho. Looking forward to supporting students' growth and learning.

Grateful for the support received so far. Here's to new beginnings and the pursuit of knowledge! 🌟
