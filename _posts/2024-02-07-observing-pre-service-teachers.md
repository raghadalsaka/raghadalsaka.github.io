This spring semester, I had the privilege of observing pre-service teachers in **EDCI 409: Integrated Elementary Methods Practicum II** at various elementary schools in Moscow.

Observing their progress in different classes and seeing their observation notes evolve was incredibly rewarding. Supporting their journey and witnessing their growth firsthand has been a highlight of my career.
